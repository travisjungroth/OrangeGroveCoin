## Our Purpose

We were inspired by [W. J. Howey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC_v._W._J._Howey_Co.) to revolutionize citrus grove service contracts.

## Reasons to Buy

Top three reasons to buy #OrangeGroveCoin:

1. It’s an investment of money.
2. It’s a common enterprise.
3. You can expect to make money from the efforts of others.


### How It Works

Each coin represents an acre of orange grove and the accompanying service contract for the blockchain to tend to the land, and harvest, pool, and market the produce. The blockchain has full and complete custody of the land and token holders are left no right of entry or any right to the produce harvested.


### How to Buy

We're going to launch as soon as we have an [SEC decision](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) that this isn't a security. Fingers crossed! In the mean time, feel free to send us an [email](mailto:jungroth@gmail.com).
